											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Negar Farshchi and I am 19 years old. My student number is s3636862 and my email address is s3636862@student.rmit.edu.au. I am from Iran. I currently study Information Technology in Australia. I have also obtained my Foundation Study certificate in Australia. I speak Persian (Iranian) and English. However, I have also undertaken French and Dutch classes but I remember nothing of those languages (Other than salute and Je ne parle pas français which means Hi, i don't speak French). The only reason I remember this sentence is because I had to go on a field trip to France with my school and the teacher told me to say that to whoever tried to talk to me. My favorite thing to do in my free time is to try new recipes from google and bake the most calorie dense chocolate filled cake ever.</p>

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style1 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Where it started?</h3>
										<p> When I was in middle school, we had compulsory robotics and aerospace engineering classes. My group and I made a hovercraft and an ROV, both which got qualified to enter the international RoboCup championships. It was then that I realised that if I knew tech, I could build and do anything. After learning a bit about cyber security and realisng how important and impactful the job is I gained a profound interest towards it. My sister also studied IT and throughout the years I saw her change jobs and enter a new department or field whenever she got bored of the last one so I also gained interest towards the fact that I am not forced to do one thing for the rest of my life with IT and there is always new opportunities to explore. Moreover, the world around us is heavily based on technology, therefore, I want to study IT to to be able to understand the life that goes by around me and take part in it.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
										<p>I chose RMIT because it had a good ranking amongst universities and also beacuse of the fact that the practical side of things matter to them as much as the acadamic side does. RMIT has a good connection with the industry which means that after graduating from RMIT a lot of students find jobs quickly due to the fact that RMIT has in a way made their path to that job easier. Moreover, RMIT has super cool buildings which made me wanna join this university even more. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-diamond"></span>
										<h3>Expectations </h3>
										<p>I expect to be able make magnificent code after my studies at RMIT that helps change the world for the better. It would also be very pleasent if I could make a robot that would do the dishes for me by the time I graduate. Ideally I would like to save a big company from a cyber secuity attack with the knowledge I gain throughout my studies at RMIT. Making a difference in the world is also a passion of mine and I hope to make an application that would achieve that one day.</p>

								</ul>
								<p class="content"> These tests give the individual a better idea of who they are and a better understanding of how they can use their personality strenghts to their benefit. Moreover, the results of the tests could also help one understand their weaknesses and try to find ways to improve on it. The result of my test indicated that I was an ENTJ which is also called the commander group. E stands for  Extraversion, N for Intuition, T for Thinking and J for  Judgment. Being an extraversion means that I enjoy spending my time with others and that i gain energy in social situations. I am more focused on the bigger picture and the events of future rather than details which is indicated by the N (intuition). I am a logical thinker and most of my decisions are based on true events and not just by my emotions. Therefore, the persoanlity type test classifies me as "T" (thinking). The last letter of my personality  shows a ' J ' because I prefer planning before I do any activity. According to the result of  this test, I would do better leading and managing the group because of the fact that I am  realistic, logical and well planned when preforming a task. I also scored 75% on my situational judgmental test which indicated that in different situations I manage to respond professionally and strategical. My learning type is visual which means that I learn better when I read or see pictures. The results of these tests helped me understand myself more. When forming a group I know that I would do a good job helping lead and manage the group. Using charts and graphs will also help me imrprove my ability to learn and achieve the team's goals.  </p>

									<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
									<p> I have a passion for helping people and I plan on making a cyber secuirty application in the future but first I need to improve on my technical skills. Hence, <br />
									Overview <br / >
		The world is overflowed with wastes and trash and the concept of recycling is still not widely used. However, that is about to change. The ‘Trashocated’ application allows users to find their nearest recycle bins as well as rewarding them when doing so. How is works is that first, it alerts users of their nearest recycle bins. Then, When the users correctly dispose of their trash, The Trashocated app gives them reward points. With those points they can shop from the Trashocated app store which contains products that are made only with recycled items. If the user choses to, they can donate their points for charitable causes. However, some drawbacks may include the huge cost of making a recycling unit as well as potential health hazards caused by unhygienic and unsafe trash.</p>

 <p>

		Motivation <br />
		Compared to 40 years ago, the number of wild life has halved, mostly because humans have destroyed and polluted the habitants of creatures. It is not a secret that the problems associated with climate is on the rise due to the selfish behavior of humans and their bad habits. However, the solution to all these problems is quite simple. Recycling. When asked the reason to why people do not recycle the answers mostly were ‘Recycling is inconvenience’, ‘I do not have space in my house to recycle’, ‘If they would pay me, I would recycle’,’ It is just hard to do’ and so on. My passion is to help people and make the world a better place. Therefore, I introduce the ‘Trashocated’ app that targets all the needs to make people. Moreover, I believe by making this application I have become a step closer to my ideal job since it will help me build my technological skills as well as help me reach my goal to help others. </p>




<p>
		Description <br/>
		The ‘Trashocated’ app it made up of two main sections. The first part consists of locating the user and the recycle bins and the second part is the store of the application where users can use their gathered points to make purchases.  The locating feature will identify the persons location and estimate the nearest recycle bin to them. With that it will estimate the distance between the two and give information about the fastest route to get to the place. In case the person does not have the time to go to the bins, there will be assigned locations which are much closer to the user. The user will drop off the items at the alternative location and an designated volunteer working for the ‘ Translocated’ company will come collect and then dispose of the garbage. However, In the case where the user does this, the reward point will be lessened from the user and will be added to the carriers’ account. To reach the goal and purpose of this application the users’ behavior to dispose properly of the garbage must be continues. Hence, the reward and store section are added to this application. The application is notified vie censors when the user discards of their rubbish accordingly and will add points to their account. There will be a list of items in the store section which includes clothing, housewares and stationary items all of which are made with recycled material. This action will slowly help the users’ behavior to change from buying substances made from raw material to buying recycled items through the Translocated company. Moreover, the app is also beneficial to charities and other in need matters. There are several different charity organizations which have an agreement with the Translocated company. The agreement suggests that not only will the Translocated company financially assist to those charity organizations, but the users of the company will also be given the choice to donate as they see fit through the reward system of the application. This process will promote humanity as well motivate others to join. The application also consists of minor elements. One of the less highlighted part of the application is the volunteering opportunities it will create for people. The volunteers will learn through making a difference and seeing firsthand the difference their work has made. The volunteers will be designated to pick up the trash left by users at the alternative locations and they will also be given the opportunity to visit big charitable organizations and comprehend the way those organizations work. Special perks will be given to volunteers as well as rewards, additionally they will also be given the freedom to choose when they want to work since there is no set time to when the users will drop off their garbage. Therefore, they will gain unique experience without the hassle of commitment.</p>

<p>
		Tools and Technology </br>

		To be able to make the Trashocated app it is firstly required for the user to have a device which can navigate or a device that contains any GPS system.  To develop this app Android studio or Xamarin, Xcode is required. To target all platforms, it is necessary to use multiple programming language each covering one aspect. Java and #C for Android users, Swift for IOS and NodeJs for websites and computer usage. However, the application must get approved by Apple for them to display on AppStore. It is worth mentioning that a fee must be given to each of the platforms to become a member. However, the prices vary upon enterprise and education.


</p>
<p>
		Skills required <br/>

		It not a requirement to know programming and coding to be able to use XCode, however, it helps greatly. IOS uses an Objective C-programming language, though they have recently introduced Swift which requires less knowledge of technology and works alongside Objective-C.  The design of the application for Android requires more of a java-based knowledge. Its is not the only one that Android supports but is the fundamental one. Android Studies will provide the opportunity to test, make and monitor the application step by step. The process taken for Android’s Google Play to publish an application is far less time consuming and a lot less stringent than it is with Apple’s App Store. Windows Phone and Windows both require a variety of languages such as C++ ,DirectX , Java script with HTML/CSS.
</p>



<p>
		Outcome </br>

		Upon success of the application, it is expected for pollution to decrease, green environment to increase and for habitants of creatures to retrieve. Moreover, the bad habits of people will be replaced with more environment friendly behaviors. By making this application, my technological skills will increase which will help me to achieve my goal of making a cyber security application that will help people by a click of a button.
